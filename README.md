# EV DATA ANALYSIS (INTERACTIVE DASHBOARD USING TABLEAU)
## Project objective
To analyze electric vehicle (EV) data to understand adoption trends, vehicle types, geographic distribution, and key manufacturers, using Excel and Tableau to create an interactive dashboard that supports data-driven insights into the EV market.

# DATA USED
<a href ="https://github.com/ishuravi001/EV-DATA-ANALYSIS/blob/main/Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.xlsx"> Dataset </a>

## KPI Questions:
-	What is the total number of electric vehicles currently registered?
-	What is the average electric range across all EVs?
-	How do BEV and PHEV vehicles compare in overall count and share?
-	How has EV adoption grown over the years by model year?
-	Which states have the highest number of electric vehicles?
-	Which manufacturers lead the EV market by total vehicles?
-	What percentage of vehicles are CAFV eligible vs not eligible?
-	Which EV models contribute the most to total vehicle volume?
  
## Process 
-	Collected and reviewed raw electric vehicle data from the source.
-	Cleaned and organized the data in Excel by handling missing values and standardizing fields.
-	Performed basic calculations and created KPI metrics in Excel.
-	Imported the cleaned data into Tableau for visualization.
-	Designed an interactive dashboard with filters, charts, and maps to analyze trends and insights.

## Project Insights
-	Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) dominate the market, accounting for the majority of total EV registrations.
-	Tesla leads EV adoption by a significant margin, with multiple models contributing to high volumes.
-	EV adoption shows a strong upward trend in recent model years, indicating growing consumer acceptance.
-	A few states contribute a large share of total EVs, highlighting regional concentration in adoption.
-	Nearly half of the vehicles are CAFV eligible, showing increasing alignment with clean fuel standards
  
## Final Conclusion:
- This analysis provides a clear view of electric vehicle growth, market leaders, and regional adoption patterns. By combining Excel for data preparation and Tableau for visualization, the dashboard delivers actionable insights that support understanding of EV market trends and informed decision-making.
